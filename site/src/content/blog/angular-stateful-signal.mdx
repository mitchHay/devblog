Angular has exposed the concept of signals for some time now, and with the release of Angular 19 soon amoung us I figured it'd be appropriate to share a new technique I've been
using to convert my rxjs `Observable`'s to what I've coined a "stateful signal".

## rxjs interop

If you've dealt with `rxjs` and observables, you may have heard of `toSignal`. No? Well the crux of it is, `toSignal` automatically subscribes to your observable 
and stores the latest value returned from it. Because `toSignal` automatically subscribes to your observable, note that any side-effects *may* be triggered 
(e.g. `tap`, `switchMap`, `map`, `finalize`).

[Learn more about the rxjs interop](https://angular.dev/guide/signals/rxjs-interop)

### Using toSignal

Find below basic usage of the `toSignal` method.

```ts
const myObservable = of('Returned value').pipe(
  take(1),
);

const mySignal = toSignal(someObservable);

console.log(mySignal()); // emits 'Returned value'
```

## Error handling and effectful services

So all this `toSignal` stuff seems cool, and you've started using it in your applications but there are a couple of things you should be mindful of.

### Error handling

> *"If an Observable used in toSignal produces an error, that error is thrown when the signal is read."*
>
> **Source:** [angular.dev](https://angular.dev/guide/signals/rxjs-interop#error-and-completion)

Given the above usage note from Angular, how should I react to errors when an observable call fails? Do I wrap my signal reads in try/catch blocks? One approach I've been using
is to create an rxjs pipeline that catches the error and saves it to your signals state allowing you to react to it safely wherever you choose.

### "Effectful" services

What's an "effectful" service? To me an effectful service is anything that runs some kind of DOM mutation (e.g. showing a loading spinner, or displaying a dialog).

Say for example, you had the following service to show a loading spinner:

```ts
class LoadingService {
  private readonly _isVisible = signal(false);

  readonly isVisible = _isVisible.asReadonly();

  toggle(isVisible: boolean): void {
    this._isVisible.set(isVisible);
  }
}
```

It's perfectly reasonable to want to show a loading spinner when some kind of API call is made. Given our current usage of `toSignal` we'd have to create some kind of separate 
state to track things like loading statuses. This can get quite cumbersome in the event we want to track loading state **per** observable.

Thinking what I'm thinking? Similar to my previous point around errors, we can also tap into our observable pipeline to track an observables loading state too!

## The Stateful Signal

Alright, that's enough chit-chat / background. You want me to cut to the chase and show you the codey code right? Lets combine the concepts around error handling and effectful services
above and create a utility class that creates a nice observable pipeline for us that tracks:

- The observables result
- Any errors that occur during the observables operation
- The observables loading state

Alright, I don't know about you but those three dot points are starting to sound like some kind of type we can return...

```ts
export type StatefulValue<T> = {
  result: T | null,
  error: unknown | null,
  isLoading: Signal<boolean>,
};
```

> **📝 Note**
> 
> It's important that `isLoading` is a signal itself here, since it needs to be reactive.

Now we have a return type, lets create the `stateful-signal.ts` utility class.

```ts
export class StatefulSignal<TInput> {
  // The $signalSubject is used here in the event we want to re-trigger the provided observable.
  private readonly $signalSubject: Subject<TInput | void>;
  private readonly isLoading = signal(false);

  constructor(subject?: Subject<TInput | void>) {
    // Allow for custom subjects, in the event we want to push some data to the observable.
    this.$signalSubject = subject ?? new Subject<TInput | void>();
  }

  create<TOutput>(createObservable: (input?: TInput) => Observable<TOutput>): Signal<StatefulValue<TOutput>> {
    // First determine the inner observable, allowing us to accurately call rxjs operators.
    // Without this, your side effects may not trigger properly.
    const determineInnerObservable = (inputValue: TInput | null | void) => {
      return inputValue
        ? createObservable(inputValue)
        : createObservable();
    };

    return toSignal(
      this.$signalSubject.pipe(
        startWith(null),
        tap(() => this.isLoading.set(true)),
        switchMap(inputValue => determineInnerObservable(inputValue).pipe(
            take(1),
            map(outputValue => ({
              result: outputValue as TOutput,
              error: null,
              isLoading: this.isLoading.asReadonly(),
            })),
            catchError(error => of({
              result: null,
              error: error,
              isLoading: this.isLoading.asReadonly(),
            })),
            finalize(() => this.isLoading.set(false)),
          )
        ),
      ),
      {
        initialValue: {
          result: null,
          error: null,
          isLoading: this.isLoading.asReadonly(),
        },
      },
    );
  }

  update(value?: TInput): void {
    this.$signalSubject.next(value);
  }
}
```

As you can see from the above code snippet, we're mapping our observables value out to `StatefulValue` so we can track things like errors and loading state. This allows us
to create reactivity later on in our application, as well as keep errors and loading state scoped **per** observable. Now it's time to stitch it all together!

### Example usage

```ts
class HomePageComponent {
  readonly state: Signal<StatefulValue<string>>;
  readonly showError = computed(() => !!this.state().error);

  constructor(private loadingService: LoadingService) {
    const getWelcomeMessage = of('Welcome!').pipe(
      delay(2500),
    );

    const welcomeMessage = new StatefulSignal();
    this.state = welcomeMessage.create(getWelcomeMessage);

    effect(() => {
      const isLoading = this.state().isLoading();

      untracked(() => {
        this.loadingService.toggle(isLoading);
      });
    });
  }
}
```

And just like that, we've captured the output of our observable into state AND tracked any errors / loading statuses automatically (go us)!

That's all folks, if you made it this far I appreciate you taking the time out of your day to read my word vomit 🫶.
