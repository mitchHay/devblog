  <h2>A little about me?</h2>
  <p>
    I've been in the software engineering industry for five years!
    I love test automation, video games, and at the risk of sounding a bit vague 
    the full vertical slice of development (although I do have a deep love for front-end 
    developement in particular)!
  </p>

  <h2>Keen to see what I've done?</h2>
  <Button text='See my work' href="/blog" />

  <h2>Want to know an absolutely shocking fact?</h2>
  <p>I actually got into programming through video games. The first thing I ever tinkered with was creating Minecraft mods and servers with Java. I quickly leaped into Unity - where I well and truly got bitten by the software dev (and game dev) bug.</p>

  <h2>I'm all about knowledge sharing</h2>
  <Button text='Read my blog' href="/blog" />

  <h2>What gets me up in the morning?</h2>
  <p>I love making applications, games, and libraries that deliver awesome user/developer experiences. I'm 110% all about bringing amazing features and experiences to anyone who uses a product Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of working on. Iâ€™m also a huge lover of knowledge sharing, mentoring, and supporting peopleâ€™s growth and development journeys in anyway I possibly can.</p>
