          <h1>Hey, I'm Mitch ðŸ‘‹</h1>
          <h2>A little about me?</h2>
          <p>Iâ€™ve been in the software engineering industry for five years! I love test automation, video games, and at the risk of sounding a bit vague the full vertical slice of development (although I do have a deep love for front-end developement in particular)!</p>
          <h2>Want to know an absolutely shocking fact?</h2>
          <p>I actually got into programming through video games. The first thing I ever tinkered with was creating Minecraft mods and servers with Java. I quickly leaped into Unity - where I well and truly got bitten by the software dev (and game dev) bug.</p>
          <h2>What gets me up in the morning?</h2>
          <p>I love making applications, games, and libraries that deliver awesome user/developer experiences. Iâ€™m 110% all about bringing amazing features and experiences to anyone who uses a product Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of working on. Iâ€™m also a huge lover of knowledge sharing, mentoring, and supporting peopleâ€™s growth and development journeys in anyway I possibly can.</p>

          <h2>What do I like?</h2>
          <p>Ice cream... and things like front-end development, game development, oh and test automation (a.k.a I like robots ðŸ¤–).</p> */}
